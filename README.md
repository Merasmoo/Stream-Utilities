# Stream-Utilities
This is a repository containing all the utilities, scripts and the like that I've created for use when streaming. Please feel free to use them and alter them as you wish. I only ask that you not sell these utilities or anything derived from them, in accordance with the GPL.

## YouTube Player with Title Card
A webpage designed to be run locally on your machine (potential live web version under consideration) which can retrieve a playlist (single videos planned to be implemented) from YouTube, shuffle it, and play it while also creating a graphic with the video's title on it for use in streams. Currently, this can only be customised by changing the code of the page itself, but I plan to make it much more user-friendly in the near future. As the qualifying statements and planned additions likely give away, this is very barebones currently.

### Choosing a Playlist
The playlist used is determined on line 54 of the code. Paste the list ID into the "list" variable, like so: 'list': 'xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
